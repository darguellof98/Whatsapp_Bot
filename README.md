# Whatsapp_Bot
I was facing a budget problem to track all my expenses, so i created a python bot connected to azure sql to register all my expenses using my most used app (whatsapp)

In this project you will need 
* A Twilio account
* Installed ngrok
* Python3
* Database engine (im using sql server on azure)


I made a funciones.py file of all my functions to use inside of my flask app and just call them
